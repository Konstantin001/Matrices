# Matrices
Contains the matrix generation software and normed matrices described in "Recreating Raven's: Software for systematically generating large numbers of Raven-like matrix problems with normed properties," published in Behavior Research Methods in 2010.

This software has not been updated to run with newer versions of Java, so it will need to be edited before it will run. However, the matrices that were used in the 2010 norming study are available for use. They are in the file "Matzen_et_al_2010_norming_stim" along with the complete data from the norming study.

If you use the software or matrices in your research, please cite: Matzen, L. E., Benz, Z. O., Dixon, K. R., Posey, J., Kroger, J. K., & Speed, A. E. (2010).
